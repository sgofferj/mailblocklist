# sipblocklist

![Addresses: 578 ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Addresses-578-green)

This blocklist was previously hosted on my website at https://www.gofferje.net.

I'm running an asterisk PBX at home since 2001. Over the years, the attempts to use it without authorization have increased massively. As far as I could find, there is no free publicly available blocklist to use with SIP enables PBXs, so I decidede to create one.

This list is updated automatically out of my firewall every 6 hours. It contains all IP addresses which tried to either brute-force user accounts on my PBX or make unauthorized calls during the last 30 days.


## Terms and conditions
- You are allowed to use the list in your systems and products free of charge
- The GNU GPL 3.0 or later applies
- I do not give any guarantees or warranties. Use entiely at your own risk and responsibility!
- I will not remove any addresses on this list manually. If your address is on the list, make sure that there's no attacks coming from your IP and it will drop off the list automatically after 30 days latest.
