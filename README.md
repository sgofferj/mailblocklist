# mailblocklist

![Addresses: 455 ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Addresses-455-green)

I have been running mailservers at home and elsewhere since 1996. Over the years, the attempts to use them without authorization have increased massively. Common mail blocklists focus primarily on mta-level client filtering. This list is intented to be used in a firewall to block malicious actors already before they create any load on the mta

This list is updated automatically out of my firewall every 6 hours. It contains all IP addresses which tried to brute-force user accounts on my mailservers or otherwise try to abuse them during the last 30 days.


## Terms and conditions
- You are allowed to use the list in your systems and products free of charge
- The GNU GPL 3.0 or later applies
- I do not give any guarantees or warranties. Use entirely at your own risk and responsibility!
- I will not remove any addresses on this list manually. If your address is on the list, make sure that there's no attacks coming from your IP and it will drop off the list automatically after 30 days latest.
